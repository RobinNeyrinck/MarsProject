## Scenario 1:

### You have the amazing idea to send your friend ‘Runing Fang’ a message and ask him if he’d be willing to go swimming together. If he wants to go then you also want to add the event as an appointment in your calendar

1. Messaging a friend is straight forward through the Messages menu, though it would also make sense to be able to message someone by clicking on them in your friends' tab
2. Adding an appointment for said swimming session is not straight forward. Logical approaches would either be through Home > Appointments > Show More which opens a menu where you can perform CRUD-operations on appointments, or to change the "+" icon in the Messages tab to a calendar icon to show the user they can create an appointment with the selected friend there. A plus sign can mean many other things such as "Add someone to this chat", "Add attachments" "Show more options". A more specific icon can be associated with specific functionality faster.

## Scenario 2:

### You think you’ve lost some weight recently, that is why you are looking for your most recently measured weight

1. I have not found a single diagram that shows weight gain/loss. The only statistic related to weight is a static weight value that probably simulates the user filling in their current weight at the time of registering for your product. There are no statistics that currently display the user has been gaining or losing weight since registration. Either add a diagram that shows weight evolution or work out a reason as to why you won't be adding that (such as ethics; you don't want a user to feel bad about them selves if they gain too much weight)
2. Unrelated but on your Physical Statistics tab you added an incorrect period tracker, women are fertile ~a week after they had their period, not after one day.
3. Also unrelated but your calendar says MDMDFSS instead of MTWTFSS, is that part of the Mars-theme or typos?

## Scenario 3:

### You feel like Chandler Bing is not doing great this past week. You feel like his mental health score has declined a bit, but how is his mental health score looking right now?

1. Can easily be found on the friends tab, no remarks.

## Scenario 1:

### You have the amazing idea to send your friend ‘Runing Fang’ a message and ask him if he’d be willing to go swimming together. If he wants to go then you also want to add the event as an appointment in your calendar

1. "Plus button" should be more clear of what it does, does it add people to the chat or does it add an appointment to the calendar? Maybe change the icon to a calendar icon or something similar.
2. You should add a cancel button to the appointment creation screen, so that the user can cancel the appointment creation if they don't want to create an appointment.

## Scenario 2:

### You think you’ve lost some weight recently, that is why you are looking for your most recently measured weight

1. Everything looks fine.

## Scenario 3:

### You feel like Chandler Bing is not doing great this past week. You feel like his mental health score has declined a bit, but how is his mental health score looking right now?

1. Not clear what the score means, is it the latest score? Is it the average score? Is it the highest score? Is it the lowest score? Maybe add a label to the score to make it more clear what the score means.
2. Make sure the graph is working, so that it shows far away you are from your goal, according to the data.
3. Maybe change the skillbar to a number? It's not clear what the skillbar means. (Daily Scores on statistics page)

## Scenario 1:

### You have the amazing idea to send your friend ‘Runing Fang’ a message and ask him if he’d be willing to go swimming together. If he wants to go then you also want to add the event as an appointment in your calendar

1. Maybe add a calendar tab so that you can see your agenda with all the appointments?
2. The 'plus button' looks like it adds people to the chat, maybe change the icon to a calendar icon or something similar.

## Scenario 2:

### You think you’ve lost some weight recently, that is why you are looking for your most recently measured weight

1. Everything looks fine and everything is where it should be.

## Scenario 3:

### You feel like Chandler Bing is not doing great this past week. You feel like his mental health score has declined a bit, but how is his mental health score looking right now?

1. Good that physical and mental statistics are separated.
2. Maybe when you click on a 'friend in need' you can go to the specific friend page and see the statistics of that friend.
